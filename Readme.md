### Hi there  👋

Hi, I'm Brandon 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

I'm a blockchain developer with a passion for making contributing to open source more accessible, creating technology to uplift people, and build community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Ethereum Blockchain with Solidity, AI, and Cloud computing. My interest in the ecosystem of decentralized networks, programming and mathematics allow me to develop projects and collaborations in this sector.
